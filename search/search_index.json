Furthermore, the participants will  have a base understanding of the expected cell types and their function  in these datasets as well as understand the complexity of the immune system.  Lastly, we will choose three cutting edge research topics to demonstrate  how the methods are used and how the challenges in the analysis present  themselves. </p>"},{"location":"#learning-experiences","title":"Learning experiences","text":"<p>To reach the learning outcomes we will use lectures, exercises, polls and group work.
